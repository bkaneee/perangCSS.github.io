		<p style="position: absolute; text-align: justify; left: 23%; top:41%">
		Miyo Sasaki is an unhappy middle school girl living in the town of Tokoname, Aichi Prefecture.
		She does not get along with her stepmother Kaoru. She always flirts with her crush, Kento Hinode,
		in spite of his repeated rejections. One day, she receives a magical Noh mask from a mysterious mask seller,
		which lets her become a cat. As "Tarō", she spends time with Hinode, keeps him company while he studies Japanese pottery,
		and listens to his problems. She longs to confess that the cat he loves and the girl he barely knows are the same person.
		One day, Miyo overhears boys at school talking trash about Hinode and loudly intervenes by jumping off the school building 
		to defend his honor. She hurts herself during the jump, and for the first time, Hinode shows warmth as he takes her to the
		nurse and shares his lunch with her. Later that evening, as Tarō, Miyo learns that Hinode's family is closing their pottery shop,
		as the family can no longer afford it. The need to cheer him up inspires Miyo to confess her love in a letter. In class,
		a boy snatches the note before she can deliver it and reads it aloud, embarrassing Miyo and Hinode. Hinode saves face by publicly
		telling Miyo that he hates her.</p>

<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0%; text-align: justify;">Miyo decides that life with Hinode as a cat is better than life without him as a human, and her human face falls off in the form of a porcelain mask. The mask seller claims her face and tells her that he will give it to a cat who wants to become human. Miyo's friends and family begin searching for her, including Hinode, who confesses to Tarō that he doesn't really hate her. Trapped in her cat body, Miyo begins losing her ability to understand humans and regrets her choice. Kinako, Kaoru's cat, obtains Miyo's human face and takes over her human life. She refuses to return Miyo's face, explaining that she is approaching the end of her natural lifespan but wishes to continue living and bring happiness to her owner.

Miyo follows the mask seller to the secret Island of Cats to convince him to turn her back into a human. Kinako comes to understand just how much Miyo's stepmom loved her cat and has a change of heart. She reveals the secret of the masks to Hinode and takes him to the island to save Miyo. Kinako gives Hinode a cat mask, which turns him into a half-cat. Kinako and Hinode are trapped by the mask seller but are rescued by Miyo and another cat who used to be a human.</p>
